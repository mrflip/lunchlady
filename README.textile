At infochimps, we buy lunch for everyone in the office(†), and it's always a pain to wrangle everyone's order in on time. *Hooray weekend app*!

Lunchlady will

* Help you know which restaurants are the best-loved, or overpriced, or haven't been ordered from in a while
* Remember everyone's past orders, if they don't get one in on time
* Make your office manager happy, which is the secret to a successful business

You can "try it out here":http://lunchladydemo.heroku.com -- thanks Heroku!

<em>(† One of many reasons you should "come work with us":http://infochimps.com/ -- there is such a thing as a free lunch!)</em>

h2. Notes

* Code for the lunchlady app is at https://github.com/infochimps/lunchlady
* The app is based on my fork of the "Greendog rails template.":https://github.com/mrflip/greendog-rails-template
* Built is in Rails 3 with devise; ajaxful_rating ("@mrbrdo & @kamui's jquery inflection":https://github.com/mrbrdo/ajaxful_rating_jquery); html5-boilerplate + compass + the compass 960.gs port + sass + hassle; friendly_id; "hashgrid.js":http://hashgrid.com/

To run the app

<pre>
  cd lunchlady
  bundle install
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed    # optional, but loads a bunch of restaurants etc. Editdb/seeds.rb and db/seeds/*.tsv to suit
  rails server
</pre>

You will want to set a signup shibboleth by editing config/app_config.yml. On heroku, you can instead set an environment variable:
  @heroku config:add SIGNUP_SHIBBOLETH=your_watchword@

h2. Behavior

h4. As a visitor to the homepage

* I should be invited to sign in or sign up if I'm not logged in.
* If I am logged in, I should be able to quickly place my order and know that it was received.

h4. As a person placing an order

* It's easy to find the restaurant's menu
* It's straightforward to type in a new order and its price
* I can call up an old order if I always get the same thing

* I can enter an order for another person
* I'm prevented from creating two orders for the same person and meal

h4. As a Lunchmeister organizing a meal

* I can create a new meal efficiently
* I get a few good robo-suggestions for the restaurant, but have absolute supreme unquestioned authority to choose any restaurant
* I can change the restaurant for a meal
  - It should be possible (but difficult) to do this once any orders have been set.
  - changing the restaurant should delete all current orders

h4. As a Lunchmeister finalizing a meal

* I can see
  - the phone number and other details of the restaurant
  - all the orders that have been placed
  - the total expected cost and the suggested tip
  - whether orders from people who typically order lunch are missing
* I can enter a "best-guess" order for somebody who hasn't ordered
* I can see metrics on each restaurant to ask for a discount, and to make sure any minimum monthly order target is hit.

h4. As a team optimizing for overall joy

* We can see 
  - actual overall price per person for each restaurant
  - how long it's been since we ordered from the restaurant
  - how much people love the restaurant
* We can make sure everyone's favorite restaurant is cycled through, even if it's not the team consensus
* So that metrics are accurate, I should not be able to edit a past meal or order, and should not be able to create ones in the unrealistic future
* restaurant votes are fair:
  - each user's votes are adjusted to their mean
  - only include regulars

h4. So that we can have visitors over

* I can invite a guest to the office and pay out-of-pocket for their meal
* We can have visitors over who will pay for their own meal.
* Correct accounting for team, company guests and co-paid guests

h4. As a team that is efficient and open, but not too open

* I should be able to place an order for another person
* If I'm logged in I can do anything, but am discouraged from doing stupid things
* It's easy for a guest to sign up given a minimal token
* It's difficult for a griefer to get an account

* If I am not logged in, the only pages I can view are
  - the homepage, which shows only some stuff
  - the login, signup, and password recovery pages

h4. Account

* list all users:
  - all users (with link), email, avatar, number of orders, is_local
* show any user:
  - user info
  - user metrics
  - rated restaurants
  - past orders  
* log out:
  - link on top when I'm signed in, not when I'm signed out.
* log in:
  - link on top when I'm signed out, not when I'm signed in.               
* register new account:
  - link on top when I'm signed out, not when I'm signed in.
  - prompts for full name, email, is_local, 
* edit my account:
  - name, email, is_local
  - change password

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

h2. TODO

* make it so you have to type a magic word into the signup box to create a new account
* validations
* http://infochimps.com/datasets/city-of-austin-restaurant-inspection-scores--2
* Stats:
  - Average per-head order price
* Time of day vs. lunchtime vs. weekends
* Do we want to be able to say "out of office"?

* --Remember past orders for restaurant and suggest them to user (rails part works, but need javascript to inject into text field)--
* --Vote for a restaurant--
* --How long since we last ordered from a restaurant--
* --consensus rating--
